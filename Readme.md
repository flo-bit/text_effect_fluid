# Text effect: Fluid Simulation

![cover](cover.png)

Inspired by the current (Jan 2024) version of [the lumalabs homepage](https://lumalabs.ai/) (obviously, their effect looks *way* better, than my quick and dirty version):

Adjusted version of this awesome [WebGL Fluid Simulation](https://github.com/PavelDoGreat/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation).

## Usage

- Add `script.js` and `LDR_LLL1_0.png` to your project

- Add this to your html

```html
    <div id="canvasContainer">
        <canvas></canvas>
        <canvas id="maskCanvas"> </canvas>
    </div>

    <script src="./script.js"></script>
```

- Add this styling

```css
    html,
    body {
        overflow: hidden;
        background-color: #000;
    }

    body {
        margin: 0;
    }

    #canvasContainer {
        position: relative;
        width: 100vw;
        height: 100vh;
    }

    canvas {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        position: absolute;
    }
```
